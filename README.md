# Machine Learning

This repository contains three notebooks:

1. An implementation of linear regression model from scratch in Python.
2. An exploration of Scikit-learn classification models.
3. An implementation of PyTorch Part of Speech tagger with 7 extensions.

All notebooks were submitted for assignments in the Machine Learning for Language Technology course at Uppsala University.
